# Color Out Of Space Mod for Minecraft 1.16.3 #

The horror which fell from the sky.

### STARTING OUT ###

* Once you spawn on a new world, you will have to hurry to collect all necessary items and materials (craft armors and weapons, and get food as fast as you can)
* After a few days, a meteorite will fall near your house
* It will infect everything around: blocks, mobs and players
* You only have one choice: get infected and then cured to get rid of the curse
* If you don't, more meteorites will fall

### BEFORE GETTING INFECTED ###

* You may want to avoid getting immediately infected
* Build another house at a safe distance from meteorite (> 60 blocks), place a bed, sleep on it, and quickly collect all you can
* Prepare all you need: food, at least two iron or diamond complete armors and swords, bows and enough arrows (strongly recommended). It's also recommended to have a map of where the meteorite fell
* Unfortunately, you are running against the clock... the longer it takes in the whole process, the curse will go worst: the infected area, as well as the number of enemies and their aggressivity, will grow 

### THE INFECTION ###

* You just need to walk on any infected block (dirt, rock or wood)
* Apart from other disgraceful effects, at this point you will not be able to loot anything from mining (you still can loot chests and hunt for food)

### THE QUEST FOR A CURE ###

* To get the antidote, you need to collect a number of souls (check the souls counter on the upper right corner of the screen)
* Only alive, human-alike mobs have souls: villagers, traders, pillagers, vindicators, invokers, illusioners and witches
* First, be sure you record somewhere the meteorite coordinates, or you have a map of the area... you'll need to come back later on
* Do not take with you everything you have. If you get killed you will need some replacement for all you need (food, armor and weapons, mainly)
* Find a village and kill everyone. Maybe you'll need to find several villages to gather enough souls for the cure.
* The raids will help you to easily find more souls... though these other souls will not be so easy to collect

### THE CURE ###

* Once you have collected all required souls, head back to the meteorite
* Perhaps there are some infected mobs guarding the meteorite. Kill'em all or run as fast as you can
* Now you can mine the meteorite (it's color will have changed, looking inactive)
* The antidote is the meteorite itself: eat it to get cured

### LOOTING YOUR REWARDS ###

* As soon as you get cured, all infected blocks will transform
* These new "cured" blocks contain very valuable rewards you may want to loot
* Be aware not all contents will be useful, nor nice, nor peaceful... Every prize has a price
* It's better you prepare for war. Again, it's strongly recommended having enough food, armors, weapons (specially swords and bows) and places to hide and heal
* Once cured, you will be able to mine again, so now you can recover yourself and gather whatever you may need before starting looting your rewards

### How do I Install it? ###

* Prepare your mod development environment: eclipse, OpenJDK and forge (there are many tutorials on the Web)
* Download repository
* Copy and replace "src" folder onto your forge example project folder
* Import the gradle project in eclipse
* Enjoy testing/improving it

### How do I get the jar file? ###

* Download the .jar file
* Copy the .jar file into your mods folder (local and server)
